                BTS Lookalike AI Test is built with Teachable Machine that is invented by Google.<br />
                The test is fairly accurate. You can check it by uploading BTS members' images to check if it returns the expected result.<br />
                To get the best result, upload an image with one face and without covering your face.<br />
                If you have any questions, please send me a direct message through Instagram below.<br />
                Thank you for using BTS Lookalike.
